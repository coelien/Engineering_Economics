## present-worth analysis:

### payback period

#### Conventional Payback Period

静态

#### Discounted Payback Period

动态

### net present worth

净现值 for evaluation of a single project 5.2.1

### break-even interest rate

盈亏平衡 which is also known as IRR, the internal rate of return :内部收益率 It is an interest rate at which the NPV=0 (Pw=0)  

### minimum attractive rate of return

Risk-free real return 
Inflation factorS
Risk premium(s)

## annual equivalence analysis:

### Annual Worth Analysis

Why do it? 

1. Evaluate a single project 

2. Seek consistency of report format

3. Determine the unit cost (or unit profit):

   Calculation of unit costs is often required in order to determine reasonable pricing for sale items.

4. Facilitate the unequal project life comparison

How to calculate? Finding AE by Conversion from PW

1. calculate the PW
2. calculate the AE

### Annual Equivalent Cost

use only when costs are involved. Costs include two parts: Operating costs 经营成本& capital costs资本成本.

## Rate-of-Return Analysis:

### Rate of Return

 internal rate of return内部收益率, marginal efficiency of capital边际资本收益, yield to maturity到期收益率, discount rate贴现率 , interest rate.

1. Return on Investment:

   A bank lends 10,000 and receives annual payment of ​4,021 over 3 years.  The bank is said to earn a return of 10% on its loan of ​10,000.  

2. Return on Invested Capital: internal rate of return

### How to find ROR?

### ROR analysis

PW Analysis: If PW(i) > 0, accept, where i is MARR.

ROR Analysis: If IRR > MARR, accept

for SIMPLE investment : break even interest rate = IRR,  see example 7.5

### Incremental analysis

## Depreciation:

### Definition

#### Economic Depreciation

经济折旧

#### Accounting Depreciation

账面折旧或资产折旧

depreciable asset

>  Assets must be used in business or held for production of income
>  Assets must have a definite useful life and a life > one  year
>  Assets that must be sth. that wears out,  gets used up, become obsolete or lose value
>

1. A qualifying asset for depreciation must satisfy all of the three characteristics above.
2. Depreciable property includes buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles and some intangible properties(such as *copyrights, designs, etc.*). 

#### Factors to consider

1. Depreciable life (how long?)
2. Salvage value (disposal value)
3.  Cost basis (depreciation basis)
4. Method of depreciation (how?)

![image-20191220210143134](/home/he/.config/Typora/typora-user-images/image-20191220210143134.png)

salvage value - is an asset’s estimated value at the end of its life

Cost basis – the total cost that is claimed as an expense over an asset's 
life, which includes the actual cost of the asset and all incidental expenses
such as freight, insurance, and site preparation.

| Cost of a new hole-punching machine (Invoice price) | $62,500 |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| + Freight                                           | 725     |
| + Installation labor                                | 2,150   |
| + Site preparation                                  | 3,500   |
| Cost basis to use in depreciation calculation       | $68,875 |

Depreciation Method

Purpose: Used to report net income to stockholders /investors

Types of Book Depreciation Methods:

1. Straight-Line Method 直线折旧法
2. Declining Balance Method  余额递减折旧法
3. Unit Production Method  单位产品工作量折旧法
